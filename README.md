# Project 5 - *Trivia Game*

Submitted by: **Andress Vizcaino Seolin**

**Trivia Game** is a trivia game that allows you to choose how many questions you can play with, what category you want to play, how difficult it is, what type of game it is (whether its true or false or multiple choice), and how long the game is.

Time spent: **16** hours spent in total

## Required Features

- [x] App launches to an Options screen where user can modify the types of questions presented when the game starts. Users should be able to choose:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The challenges I faced when making this app was fixing the way the questions were formatted, as some of them would provide a JSON that was not
translated properly. I also had trouble making the questions stay in place, it seemed as if it would move with the timer as it went down.
